That is a simple virtualenv bootstrap script that eases the setup of
django nonrel. Just put on your $PATH and run like normal virtualenv
command.Example:

prep_nonrel nonrel

Then activate your environment and go to your ready appengine directory : django_testapp
To be able to use it properly you need to have Python Appengine SDK installed and dev_appserver.py
should be on your $PATH.
